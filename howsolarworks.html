			<h2>Article 1: Solar panels</h2>
			<p>Simply put, a solar panel works by allowing photons, or particles of light, to knock electrons free from atoms, generating a flow of electricity. Solar panels actually comprise many, smaller units called photovoltaic cells. (Photovoltaic simply means they convert sunlight into electricity.) Many cells linked together make up a solar panel. Each photovoltaic cell is basically a sandwich made up of two slices of semi-conducting material, usually silicon — the same stuff used in microelectronics.</p>

			<h2>Article 2: Charge controller</h2>
			<p> A solar charge controller manages the power going into the battery bank from the solar array.  It ensures that the deep cycle batteries are not overcharged during the day, and that the power doesn’t run backwards to the solar panels overnight and drain the batteries. Some charge controllers are available with additional capabilities, like lighting and load control, but managing the power is its primary job.</p>
			<p>A solar charge controller is available in two different technologies, PWM and MPPT. How they perform in a system is very different from each other. An MPPT charge controller is more expensive than a PWM charge controller, and it is often worth it to pay the extra money.</p>

			<h2>Article 3: Battery system</h2>
			<p>Solar Battery systems are designed to store the excess energy from your PV system. They are capable of monitoring the homes usage of electricity.  The internal battery management system will automatically divert the excess energy to your battery, rather than allow it to generate back onto the grid. The battery system will then distribute the stored energy when it detects a demand in the house greater than the PV system can provide.  Or when there is no PV generation, providing there is sufficient energy stored in the battery.</p>
			<p>It is important to remember most battery systems give priority to the loads in the house before charging the battery.  However, we are now seeing systems that allow you to choose the priority.</p>

			<h2>Article 4: DC power</h2>
			<P>A DC-connected energy storage system connects to the grid mains at the same place as the solar panels; this usually means that they share a ‘hybrid’ inverter. You can think of this as a ‘one box’ solution, because there is only one inverter instead of two.</P>
			<P>Because they contain fewer components (which usually translates into lower costs), we generally recommend DC-coupled systems for homes considering a brand new solar & storage system (as opposed to a retrofit). Having a single inverter also allows households to get around local network capacity restrictions, which can be prohibitively small in some areas.</P>

			<h2>Article 5: Inverter</h2>
			<p>A solar inverter is one of the most important elements of the solar electric power system. It converts the variable direct current (DC) output of a photovoltaic (PV) solar panel into alternating 240V current (AC). This AC electricity then can be fed into your home to operate your appliances.</p>
			<p>The electricity that is not used in your home is then either fed into the grid (electrical power lines) or into home battery storage. New hybrid inverters include an integrated battery management system.</p>

			<h2>Article 6: AC power</h2>
			<p>An AC-coupled storage system is connected to the AC grid mains that service the property (that is, the lines coming in from the street).. You can think of this type of arrangement as a ‘two box’ solution – because there is one ‘box’ (inverter) for the solar panels, and another for the battery bank.</p>
			<p>The main advantage of AC-coupled battery storage is that it is the easiest and generally more cost-effective way to retrofit batteries onto a pre-existing solar PV system.</p>
